# Antigravity CLI Terminal for Home Assistant

Bring the power of Google's **Antigravity CLI** directly to your Home Assistant dashboard! 

Antigravity CLI Terminal provides an AI-driven, persistent web terminal pre-configured with the Home Assistant MCP (`ha-mcp`) server, giving Antigravity native access to your smart home environment.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Google Antigravity CLI Integration**: A full-featured web terminal with the official Antigravity CLI (`agy`) pre-installed.
* **Native Home Assistant Control**: Thanks to the integrated `ha-mcp` server, Antigravity can read states, call services, and interact with your entities natively.
* **Session Persistence**: Built-in `tmux` support means you can navigate away or refresh without losing your terminal session or AI conversation.
* **Smart Environment Context**: Automatically creates a `GEMINI.md` (and `.antigravityignore` / `.aiexclude`) file loaded with system info, architecture, and recent logs to ground the AI in your specific setup.
* **Seamless Authentication**: Configure your `gemini_api_key` straight from the Home Assistant add-on UI, automatically loaded as `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for authentication.
* **Direct Config Access**: Boots directly into your `/config` directory for immediate YAML editing and troubleshooting.
