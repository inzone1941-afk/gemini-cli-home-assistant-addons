# Antigravity CLI Terminal Add-on - Development Status

## Project Overview
Refitting the Home Assistant add-on to support Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`), including interactive session management, Home Assistant MCP integration, and automated context generation.

## Current Status: 🟢 **Stable Release (v3.0.1)**

### ✅ **Completed Tasks**

#### Core Implementation
- ✅ **Antigravity CLI Integration**: Successfully installed and configured Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`).
- ✅ **API Key Support**: Added `antigravity_api_key` to add-on configuration for headless login.
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Built-in `tmux` support for conversation persistence across Web UI reconnections.
- ✅ **Home Assistant MCP**: Pre-installed and configured `ha-mcp` for natural language control.
- ✅ **Smart Context**: Automated generation of `ANTIGRAVITY.md` for AI system awareness.

#### Testing & Validation
- ✅ **Authentication**: Verified both OAuth and API key authentication flows.
- ✅ **MCP Integration**: Verified MCP list shows active Home Assistant connection.
- ✅ **Persistence**: Verified session data and credentials survive container restarts.
- ✅ **Multi-Arch**: Validated build configuration for amd64 and aarch64.
