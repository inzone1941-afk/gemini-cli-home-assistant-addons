## What is Antigravity CLI Terminal?

This add-on provides a web-based terminal interface with the Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`) pre-installed, allowing you to use Antigravity's powerful AI capabilities directly from your Home Assistant dashboard. It gives you direct access to Google's Antigravity AI assistant through a terminal, ideal for:

- **🏠 Smart Home Control**: Use natural language to control devices via the built-in Home Assistant MCP server.
- **💻 Coding Assistant**: Get help with Home Assistant YAML, Python scripts, and complex automations.
- **🔍 Advanced Debugging**: Analyze Home Assistant logs and troubleshoot issues with AI assistance.
- **🧠 System Awareness**: Antigravity automatically understands your entities, system info, and recent logs through "Smart Context" (`GEMINI.md`).

## Key Features

- **🚀 Auto-Launch & Session Picker**: Starts Antigravity automatically or provides a menu to manage sessions.
- **🔗 Deep Home Assistant Integration**: Pre-configured Home Assistant MCP server for native control of your home.
- **📝 Smart Context**: Automatically generates a context file with your system state for the AI to read.
- **🛡️ Secure Headless Auth**: Use your Google Gemini/Antigravity API Key for zero-config, persistent authentication.
- **📦 Persistent Packages**: Install APT and PIP packages that survive container restarts.
- **🎨 Polished UI**: High-performance terminal (`ttyd`) with support for themes (Breeze, Dracula, Nord, etc.).
- **🔄 Session Persistence**: Built-in `tmux` ensures your sessions stay alive even if you close the browser.

## Quick Start

The terminal automatically starts Antigravity when you open it. You can immediately start using commands like:

```bash
# Ask Antigravity about your smart home
agy -p "Is the coffee maker on?"

# Start an interactive coding/chat session
agy

# Drop to bash and run context checks
ha-context
```
